## Install

`npm install generative.scss --save-dev`

or link directly to minified source:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="//unpkg.com/generative.scss@1.1.0/dist/generative.min.css">`

## Usage

Generative.scss ships with options to include utility `headings`, `margins`, `paddings` and `widths`. The default settings for each utility group can be found in `src/_settings.scss`. It is as easy as commenting out a Sass import to not include a utility group as needed.
